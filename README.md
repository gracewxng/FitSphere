# FitSphere

## Inspiration
The sports and wellness sector presents a significant opportunity for a positive impact, especially considering the prevalent issue of inadequate exercise levels among many individuals. Upon further thought and research, we found it difficult for people to begin their fitness journey and maintain a consistent workout plan in accordance with their goals. Taking these market trends into consideration, we wanted to design a website that was beginner-friendly and would motivate people to start their fitness journey!

## What it does
FITSPHERE aims to be a beginner-friendly exercise platform. Our users can explore different workout exercises, from using machines at the gym to starting their fitness journey at home. With FITSPHERE, beginners have the opportunity to select a particular muscle group they wish to target, utilizing an intuitive interface featuring interactive muscle diagrams. The exercises are accompanied by a description and image demonstration to help users better understand their workouts.

## How we built it
FITSPHERE was built using multiple languages and frameworks. The front end was developed with React, chosen for its versatility and responsive elements. This was accompanied by languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and enhance the website design.

## Challenges we ran into
This was our first hackathon, which provided an enriching experience for our entire team and allowed us to acquire new skills in a condensed timeframe. We encountered various challenges during our journey, including learning to collaborate effectively on GitHub and resolving conflicts when merging our code. Additionally, mastering the syntax and formatting of languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS proved to be a learning curve for us as we were new to these languages. However, we successfully navigated through these obstacles with the guidance of mentors, tutorial videos, and online resources.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in our team's collaborative abilities and our capacity to promptly address conflicts as they arise. By effectively resolving these challenges, we maintained our momentum and maximized our productivity, offering valuable learning experiences for each team member. The skills acquired during this hackathon have equipped us for future endeavours, and we're enthusiastic about applying them to upcoming projects and competitions.

## What we learned
Our developers had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with React, JavaScript, HMTL, and CSS, while our designer and product manager conducted thorough market analyses, ensuring precise alignment with our target audienceâ€™s needs and preferences.

## What's next for FITSPHERE
As FITSPHERE grows its user community, we're excited to enhance our platform by leveraging AI to provide personalized workout recommendations. We plan to partner with local gyms, offering exclusive
